# Fake-Review-Detection-using-BERT-on-Amazon-Dataset  

This repository contains the implementation of my research paper **“Fake Review Detection Using Transformer-Based Approach on Amazon Dataset”**, accepted at **ICECET 2025**.  
The project focuses on detecting **authentic vs. fake reviews** using a **Transformer-based model (BERT)** fine-tuned on a preprocessed Amazon reviews dataset.  

---

##  Key Features  
- **Amazon Reviews Dataset** (preprocessed with sentiment & metadata)  
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, cleaning, and embedding  
- **Modeling**: Fine-tuned **BERT for binary classification**  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- **Robust Detection**: Overcomes limitations of traditional ML models by leveraging BERT’s bidirectional context understanding

## Tech Stack  
- Python (3.10)  
- PyTorch  
- Transformers (BERT)  
- Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
